Hey, beautiful. Stop crying because it is over. Start smiling because that ungrateful loser is someone elses problem. Don't be sad that he chose her over you, stop counting your thunderstorms, and start counting your rainbows! Hey pal, if they hurt you again, just tell me, I can make their death look like an accident! Donâ€™t worry I have got your back.
